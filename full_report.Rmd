## Introduction

State the research question and why it is important to study in your own words.

## Data

Describe the dataset being used in your own words. Describe and show the distributions of key variables in the analysis. You can copy and past the code chunk below to produce figures.

```{r fig.cap="A Caption"}
#code (e.g. plot, hist, barplot, boxplot) to produce the figure
```

## Results

Describe the results of the full multivariate regression models. You can use the code chunk template below to place the regression results into a nice format using the texreg package. This code chunk is initially set to not run when this document is knitted. Change `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE` to allow it to run. 

```{r, results='asis', eval=FALSE}
#make some models. You may need more or less than four. 
model1 <- lm()
model2 <- lm()
model3 <- lm()
model4 <- lm()

#change from screenreg to texreg for knitting
screenreg(list(model1, model2, model3, model4),
       caption="A caption",
       caption.above = TRUE,
       #Comment out custom.coef.names until your models are ready for knitting
       #custom.coef.names = c("Intercept",
      #                       "names",
      #                      "of",
      #                       "each",
      #                       "line",
      #                       "of",
      #                       "table"),
       custom.gof.names = c("R-squared","N"),
       digits=2,
       include.adjrs=FALSE, include.rmse=FALSE,
       custom.note = "%stars. Standard errors in parenthesis.")
```

A discussion of the results of your table should go here, **not** in conclusions. 

## Conclusions

A paragraph to summarize your report and what you draw from these results regarding your original research question.
